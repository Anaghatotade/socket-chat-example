## Overview

Traditional web stacks often make real-time chat difficult, relying on inefficient polling for updates. Sockets provide a persistent, bi-directional channel, allowing the server to push messages to all connected clients instantly. This is the foundation of most modern chat systems.

## Why Sockets?

- **Real-Time:** Messages are delivered instantly to all users.
- **Bi-Directional:** Both client and server can send and receive data at any time.
- **Efficient:** No need for constant polling or manual refreshes.

## Features

- Send and receive messages in real time.
- Broadcast messages to all connected users.
- Simple, responsive chat interface.
- Minimal setup—runs locally in your browser.
